> OrbitDB Benchmark Runner

## Install

`npm i orbit-db-benchmark-runner`

## CLI Usage

Check [cli.js](./src/cli.js) or use `npx benchmarker -h` for help

*If you want to run benchmarks in a folder have their file name end in `.benchmark.js`.*

```
Options:
  -V, --version             output the version number
  -b, --benchmarks <path>   benchmark folder or file (default: "./benchmarks")
  -o, --output <file path>  report output path (.html or .json)
  -i, --baselines <path>    baselines to use for comparison (.json output)
  --no-node                 skip nodejs benchmarks
  --no-browser              skip browser benchmarks
```

##### Running Comparisons

1. Create the baseline report output to use for comparison: `npx benchmarker -o report.json`
2. Use the output baseline report with the baseline option: `npx benchmarker -i report.json`

***benchmarks ran for comparison are best ran on their own machine or a machine with few other things happening in the background***

## Writing Benchmarks

Benchmark files must export an object with an asynchronous method `benchmark`. The method takes 1 parameter `benchmarker` which is used to control the recording and give information about the benchmark. Please see [test.benchmark.js]('./test/fixtures/benchmarks/test.benchmark.js') for an example.
